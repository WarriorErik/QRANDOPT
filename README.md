# QRANDOPT
My Master’s thesis project: An AI‑enhanced Qiskit simulation framework for quantum randomness extraction—combining classical and RL‑tuned post‐processing, realistic noise modeling, and rigorous NIST/entropy benchmarking in interactive Jupyter Notebooks.


### NIST SP 800‑22 Integration

We use the pure‑Python [`nistrng`](https://pypi.org/project/nistrng/) package to automate the entire SP 800‑22 test suite directly in Jupyter. In the notebook:

 Install:  
   
   pip install nistrng
